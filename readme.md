# Subatomic

## What is it?

Subatomic is a set of utilities to ease the development of modular state management patterns with Redux (also known as [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)). Subatomic assumes the usage of at least [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect), but also optionally supports [Immutable-js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js). You may also find a [subatomic reference app skeleton](https://github.com/andrew-codes/subatomic-reference-app) with additional information on modular state management and how it may look in an application.
